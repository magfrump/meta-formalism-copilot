# Metaformalism Copilot

A workspace for transforming insights, smells and ideas from source materials(ex: conversations, text, etc) into personalized, context-sensitive formalisms.

## What is this?

Metaformalism Copilot is an extension of the [Live Conversational Threads](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uueHkKrGmeEsKGHPR/live-conversational-threads-not-an-ai-notetaker-2) research project. Rather than producing unified, context-independent theories, this tool helps generate **pluralistic formalisms** - multiple rigorous representations of the same insight, each tailored to the specific context where it will be used.

### The Philosophy: Live Theory

Instead of generalizing via exclusion (finding what's common and discarding the rest), Live Theory proposes **generalization via inclusion** - acknowledging that abstract concepts may need different formal representations in different contexts. This tool:

- Treats post-rigorous insights as first-class artifacts worthy of formalization
- Enables human-centered AI interaction that supports discernment rather than passive consumption
- Produces formalisms that are sensitive to the local context and research interests of the user
- Emphasizes **iterative improvement** and a **bidirectional approach** - you shape the output through refinement rather than passively accepting what's generated

### How it works

The interface supports a collaborative, iterative workflow:

- **Left Panel**: Enter source material (insights, research notes, conceptual material) and describe the theoretical context or domain for formalization. Refine your context description iteratively before generating output.
- **Right Panel**: View the generated formalism and actively shape it through AI-assisted editing:
  - Edit selected portions with inline instructions
  - Transform the entire output with high-level directives
  - Manual editing combined with AI suggestions

This bidirectional approach ensures you remain an active participant in the formalization process, not a passive consumer of AI output.

Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Docker (for Lean 4 verification)

### Install and run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to use the application.

### Lean Verification Service

The app includes a Dockerized Lean 4 verification service. When running, submitted Lean code is type-checked by a real Lean 4 installation. When the service is not running, the app falls back to a mock response.

**Start the verifier:**

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The first build downloads the Lean 4 toolchain and caches it in the image, so it will take several minutes. Subsequent builds use the Docker cache and are fast.

The verifier runs on port 3100. You can test it directly:

```bash
# Should return { "valid": true }
curl -X POST http://localhost:3100/verify \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"leanCode":"theorem t : True := trivial"}'

# Should return { "valid": false, "errors": "..." }
curl -X POST http://localhost:3100/verify \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"leanCode":"theorem t : False := trivial"}'
```

**Configuration:** The Next.js route reads `LEAN_VERIFIER_URL` from the environment (defaults to `http://localhost:3100`).

**Stop the verifier:**

```bash
docker compose down
```

The app continues to work without the verifier — the API route falls back to a mock `{ valid: true, mock: true }` response.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions! Please follow these guidelines:

### Pull Request Workflow

1. **Create a branch** for your feature or fix
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the existing code structure

3. **Test your changes** locally with `npm run dev`

4. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive messages
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: description of what you added"
   ```

5. **Push your branch** and create a Pull Request
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Do NOT commit directly to main** - all changes must go through Pull Requests

### Code Guidelines

- Follow the existing folder structure in `app/components/features/`
- Use TypeScript for all new components
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling (CSS variables in `globals.css`)
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Keep components modular and focused on a single responsibility
- Test your changes across different screen sizes

### Before Submitting

- Ensure `npm run lint` passes without errors
- Verify the UI works in both light backgrounds
- Check that all imports use the correct paths
- Remove any console.logs or debug code
